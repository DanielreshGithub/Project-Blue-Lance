# Project-Blue-Lance
A Human-in-the-Loop Risk Modeling Framework for Civilian Harm Mitigation


# Project Blue Lance is an open-source early-warning system that estimates the risk of civilian harm across regions using historical conflict, protest, and population data.

The system analyzes patterns in past violence and unrest and uses machine-learning models to forecast whether a given region faces low, medium, or high civilian-harm risk in the near future.

Blue Lance is designed for research, humanitarian analysis, and policy insight — not for targeting or operational military use.
